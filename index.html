            <p class="center">Parent Lottery</p>
            <p class="p">When I reflect on my life, I am sure that I have won the parent lottery.</p>
            <p class="p">At the beginning of my life, my parents had just moved to Canada after leaving their comfortable lives in China behind them. They brought nothing with them except for some clothes and very little money with the hopes of starting a new life. Both of my parents graduated from elite universities in China and came to the Americas to continue their schooling and to make a better life for me.</p>
            <p class="p">My mom is a hardworking person with perseverance like no other. She was an accounting major and went to Canada to study computer science. During the end of her senior year, I was born and yet she still persevered and continued her schooling. She graduated and then went to the University of Michigan to get her Master’s degree in computer science.</p>
            <p class="p">My dad is a laid back and caring person. He was a chemistry major and went to Canada to get his Master’s degree in chemistry. After he finished his schooling, he got a job and started working to help the family become more financially stable while my mom went to school.</p>
            <p class="p">Because my parents had just moved, we were financially supported by the government; the government gave us a place to live and gave us some money for living expenses. During that time, we had just enough money to eat. When I was about a year old, my grandparents took me to China where I stayed for four years. During that time, my mom finished school and tried to find a job to help my dad support the family. </p>
            <p class="p">I moved back to Canada when I was about 5 years old. My mom and dad both finished school and were able to financially support the family but only by living a frugal lifestyle and not spending too much on “useless” items. My dad said, “加拿大什么都没有。地震，战争，海啸，和工作，都没有。” which roughly translates to “Canada has nothing. No earthquakes, no wars, no tsunamis, and no jobs.” Because of the lack of high paying jobs and jobs in general, my mom decided to move to California and seek jobs here.</p>
            <p class="p">She came to California and yet again brought nothing with her except a little bit of money and clothes. She rented a room and started to look for a job. During this time, my dad and I were both in Canada and living a comfortable life. After a year, my dad and I moved to California and we lived in an apartment in the city of Lomita. This apartment was made fully of wood and looked like a log cabin in the forest or the mountains. My dad worked very hard to find a job but it took him a few months to find one. My mom always said that she was the only person supporting the family and that my dad and I were just spending money wherever we wanted. Even though my dad has a decent job now, my mom still says the same things.</p>
            <p class="p">My mom is a very hardworking person and has done many things that I think I will never be able to do in my life. She moved to two different countries and started both times with nothing, she is very persistent and she always gets what she wants. I have always thought of her as an amazing person because no matter what's in her way, she will just destroy it and move on. Due to her hard work, we moved to a bigger apartment and then we were able to buy a house in Cypress where I am now. </p>
            <p class="p">My dad always seemed like a very rich person to me when I was little. During the time he didn’t have a job, he picked me up from school on Friday every week and took me to the movies. I thought he was the richest man in the world because he took me to see a movie every week, but later, I found out that certain movies were free over the weekends.</p>
            <p class="p">My dad snuck in popcorn for us by wrapping the popcorn in a jacket and clumping it up in the bag to make it look like it was just a jacket. The most creative way that he concealed his food was putting the popcorn in a metal water bottle and pretending it was just water.</p>
            <p class="p">My parents were inspirational to me, and taught me many things about being a good citizen in society. There was one part of my life that was crucial to building my character: I was in 5th grade and I stole from my mom. </p>
            <p class="p">There was this set of Minecraft handbooks that I wanted at a book fair. I asked my dad to buy them for me but he refused. I then asked my mom for the books, but she gave me a lecture about how I should read the books that were useful to me like novel books with more words. The book fair lasted for about a week and I asked them every day for the books and they refused every time. The last day of the book fair, I got the idea to steal from my mom. Now that I look back, it seems like the same scene from the movie Inside Out. I woke up in the middle of the night and I took 20 dollars from my mom's purse and put it in my backpack.</p>
            <p class="p">The next day, I went to school like nothing happened and I bought the four books with the stolen money. During that time, I felt very guilty and I was very alert for the rest of the day. I felt like a criminal.</p>
            <p class="p">After school, I had to go to an after school program where I showed off my new books to my friends. I felt so proud of myself for some reason but the guilt came back when my dad came to pick me up. I was holding the four books when I got onto the car and my dad grew suspicious. I hoped that he would forget about the books and move on, but when I got home, he asked me where I got the books. When he asked me this question, my heart began to race and I did not know how to respond. I quickly made up a lie and said that I borrowed them from the library and he believed me. I thought I was free and I had just escaped the clutches of my parents. I felt good about myself but that was all going to end when my mom got home.</p>
            <p class="p">When my mom got home, I was already getting ready to go to bed. She was downstairs and was also getting ready for bed when she decided to check my backpack to see if I had put everything away. She opened my bag and found a piece of white paper with black ink printed on it, and read it. This piece of paper marked my fate but it also was very important to my life. Without that piece of paper, I would not be who I am today and my acts of stealing and lying would not end there. </p>
            <p class="p">The piece of paper in my bag was the receipt for the purchase I made with the stolen 20 dollars. I  saw that every time my dad made a purchase, he kept the receipt, so I kept it after I bought the books. When my mom saw this, she showed it to my dad and he came up the stairs and walked into my room. He was laughing hysterically. Though he was very mad at me, the fact that I kept evidence of my crime made him very amused. After he finished laughing, he said to me, “How was your day today?” At that time, I did not know that he had found out about my crime so my day was going quite well. Then he followed up with the question that I would ask myself every day from that point on. He then asked, “How dumb are you?” He then took out the receipt and said, “I think this is yours” and gave it to me. I looked at it and I knew that my day had just taken a turn for the worse. My mom then entered the room with a wooden spoon and made sure that I will remember to never steal again. </p>
            <p class="p">Even though at that time I hated my parents, I thank my mom for what she did. If she did not show me that stealing was bad I would have gone down a very bad path in life and I might have ruined the rest of my life. Even now, I look at my books and I think of that time. They are a constant reminder of what happened that day and that stealing is not right. </p>
            <p class="p">My parents are the best parents that I could have hoped for. They are inspirational, funny, caring, loving, and they have taught me how to be a good person in society. I would be a very different person without their help and guidance. I definitely had the lucky numbers in the parent lottery.</p>

        <div class="essay">
            <p class="center">Never made it to Junior Olympics</p>
            <p class="p">Swimming was a very big part of my life. While I was swimming, I realized the importance of exercise, perseverance, and the results of hard work.             </p>
            <p class="p">It all started when I went to a club in the summer of 2015. My mom signed me up for a robotics club with my friend. He was on a swim team but I never dreamed of entering the sport of competitive swimming. Because I did not know how to swim. The best I could do was stand in the shallow end or sit in a Floatie. On the first day of the club, my friend said to me, “You should swim! I have practice today and you should come.” I did not want to tell him that I did not know how to swim so I responded with a “Maybe” He went up to my mom after the meeting ended and asked her if I can join him in swim practice. My mom, being the person that she is, said, “Of course! though Andrew does not know how to swim. Do you think he will make it?” When she said that, I was very embarrassed and I expected my friend to laugh at me. I waited and waited, but the laughter never came. Instead, he said, “That is fine, I’ll teach him!” To this day, I am thankful for my friend’s generosity. Because without him, I would never have had a chance at swimming. </p>
            <p class="p">Later that day, my mom brought both of us to the swim center where he swam. My friend went up to the coach and asked him if I could join. The coach said, “Of course!” and gave me an opportunity to try out. I got into the water and started to swim. At that time, I did not know how to turn my head and breathe but I did know how to swim freestyle. Because of this, I had to stop many times on my journey to the other side. I finally made it back and the coach looked at me and said, “Good work! You made it!” I was stunned. I did not know how to swim and yet he let me be on the team. I was both grateful and scared that I made it, but I was determined that one day I would be the fastest on the team. </p>
            <p class="p">The coach put me in the same lane as my friend who kept his word and tried to teach me how to swim. He demonstrated his swimming to show me the correct form and how to breathe. I was shocked at how fast he was. I felt that his speed was beyond my reach and that I would never be able to beat him. But, I was determined to beat him. I vowed that one day that I would be faster than him and I will try my best to beat him.</p>
            <p class="p">My dad enrolled me in private lessons at a swimming facility after that first swim practice. The swim instructors taught me how to breathe, the four different strokes, and correct form. I took about a month to learn the strokes and correct my form. I was also training with the swim team and getting a little faster every day. </p>
            <p class="p">A few months later, I was finally able to swim in my first race. The day before, I learned how to dive, and when to start the race. I was extremely nervous in the car beforehand and I was afraid that I would do bad and not get a good time. I tried to avoid the race so I could not possibly get a bad time. I went up to my coach and asked him if I could leave and not swim. I explained to him that I did not want to get a bad time and be a failure. He then said to me, “The only failure is when you give up and try to escape your problems.” What he said has stuck with me. That day, I was able to experience my first race and get one step closer to being the fastest on my team. </p>
            <p class="p">A few years passed by. I have been swimming now for four years. Over these 4 years, I practiced and trained hard. Every day I got a little faster. All those days of hard work slowly built up and I became much faster than I was when I started. In June in the summer of 2019 with junior olympics in July, I had my last chance. </p>
            <p class="p">In competitive swimming, Junior Olympics, or JO’s, is the fastest race. All my hard work was to qualify for the Junior Olympics. My times were very close and I just needed to drop a few seconds. I was almost there. In the previous school year, I had joined my school’s swim team where I had most of my best times. Most of those times qualified for JO’s and my coach was working hard to transfer them over. While the times transferred, I had one more meet to try to achieve those times so I could guarantee qualifications for JO’s. During that swim meet, I was on my last race. I missed the other races by a few milliseconds so I did not make the time. This was my last race, my last chance. The referee signaled to get on the diving block and take our marks. I closed my eyes and got ready. </p>
            <p class="p">“Swimmers take your mark, **BEEP**”</p>
            <p class="p">I dove into the pool and swam as fast as I could. I thought about everyone who believed in me, and how hard I had worked. I pushed forward through the water and I felt a sharp pain in my leg. I ignored it but it got worse and worse. Suddenly, I couldn't move my leg anymore. I was on my last lap and I had almost finished. The pain was unbearable. My leg was cramped up due to the break I took a few weeks before. I looked at the time board and looked for my time. I missed JO’s by half a second. </p>
            <p class="p">When I got out of the water, I stretched my leg and limped to my coach. He told me that I was so close to making the time but I suddenly slowed down. My coach told me later that my times did not transfer. There was a typo in my name on the team’s records and so the times did not transfer. I didn’t make it.</p>
            <p class="p">Now that I look back, I feel that not making JO’s has helped me more than if I had made it. If I had made it, I would have a different perspective of hard work. A few weeks before the meet, I took a break for a month. If I had made it, I would have thought that I did not need to put in much effort to be fast. I would have thought that the break did not affect me and that taking long breaks wouldn’t matter. I would think that I would not have to work hard for what I want. Because I didn't make it, I know these things are not true. I learned that hard work is very important to achieve goals and procrastination is never key. The main lesson I learned, however, was that nothing comes for free and achievement requires hard work. </p>

            <p class="center">The Happiest place on Earth</p>
            <p class="p">Ever since I was little, I have always thought that the happiest place on Earth is the internet. The internet is a vast plane with thousands of different resources and things to see. I always feel amazed every time I look at it. Every day, there are new things to do and new things to see. My love for the internet started when my dad showed me his computer. </p>
            <p class="p">I was about six years old and my parents and I were living in an apartment. One afternoon, I was playing in my room and I got bored. I wanted something new but there was nothing. I could play with Legos, but I did not want to ruin my masterpiece. I could go outside, but my parents did not let me leave the house alone. I could sleep, but it was sunny and hot. Running out of ideas, I walked out of my room and into the living room of the tiny apartment. I saw my dad hunched over his laptop so I decided to go and see what he was doing. He was on a shopping site and was scrolling through the deals and looking for something to buy. Before that day, I wasn't really interested in the internet but soon I would be unable to live without it. </p>
            <p class="p">When I reached the age of eight, I became more familiar with the internet and I got a cool new game called Minecraft. I would come home every day and use my dad’s laptop to play games and browse the internet. I would play Minecraft for hours then I would go directly to sleep. My parents had enough of that and said that I needed to study more and play less games. To ensure that I didn't play that much anymore, they changed the password so the computer and basically closed the door to my happy place. I felt very frustrated but this helped me discover many other aspects of the internet and helped me discover many other parts of it.</p>
            <p class="p">When I was in 6th grade, my teacher wanted some people to learn how to code. I always wanted to learn how the internet worked and how different actions are executed so I signed up for the class. My teacher gave me a code for a tutorial and software to start off my coding career. On my way home, I was extremely excited and I quickly ran home. When I got home, I opened the computer and quickly started the tutorial. </p>
            <p class="p">After a few years, I became fluent in many different languages and I was able to create websites and games. Because of this, my love for the internet grew and grew. I was getting obsessed with what I could do and what I could see. The internet allowed me to travel to any part of the world and to see anything. I was able to create my own world and the results were infinite. When I got home, I would try to create new things and I was never bored again. </p>
            <p class="p">When I reached high school, my love for the internet helped me get through tough projects that required creativity and also helped me see the world. The internet gave me a sense of peace and it always surprised me. Through the internet, I was able to talk to my relatives who are thousands of miles away. Through the internet, I was able to create worlds in my vision. I was able to do anything. I felt like a bird soaring through the sky. I felt free. </p>

            <p class="center">My Grandfather</p>
            <p class="p">When I was a child, I was sent to my grandparents' home in China where I lived for five years. During those years, my grandpa helped me become the person I am today. </p>
            <p class="p">When I was a few months old, I left my parents and went to live with my grandparents in China. Because my parents needed to finish graduate school and find a stable income to support the family. During this time, I did not know how to walk or even talk. I started my life in China with my grandparents. </p>
            <p class="p">My grandpa is a very important figure in my life. When I was little, he taught me the traditions of the family and how to behave in public. He was the father figure of my early childhood. Many of the memories that I had early in my life were with him. My grandfather takes very good care of his health and lives a very healthy life. Every morning, he would wake up early and exercise for about an hour then go about his day. Because of his perseverance, he is in great physical shape even though he is in his 70s. One morning, when I was about four years old, my grandpa told me that he was going to take me to a magical place. When I heard this, I got excited and quickly got ready to go. Once we got onto the street, we started to walk towards the outskirts of the city. After a few hours, we got to a park and continued along a path towards the center of the park. Once we got there, I saw a huge pond with trees growing around it. I quickly ran towards the pond and stood awestruck as I took in my surroundings. Then my grandpa told me to look down into the pond and tell him what I saw. I looked down and to my amazement, I saw a school of colorful koi fish swimming around. Never in my life had I seen so many colors of fish in a pond. </p>
            <p class="p">Another memory of my grandfather was when I was in fourth grade. My grandparents came to visit. They came to check on how I was doing and to lessen the stress on my parents. Every day, my grandfather would walk me home. During that time, I was in my school’s band program and I had a rolling backpack. Every day when school ended, he would take me to a nearby park and watch me do my homework. Then, I would quickly return to school to attend band practice. One day, I came back from band practice and I was playing with a piece string. On the way home, the end of the string got caught inside the wheel of my rolling backpack and the wheel got jammed. Since my grandpa was pulling it, he immediately felt the extra resistance from the jammed wheel. He set the backpack on a nearby table, looked at the wheel and began to fix it. He had no tools and was struggling to get the string out from between the small gap that separated the wheel from the backpack. I thought that the damage was permanent and that there was no way of fixing it. It had been over 10 minutes and I had already given up even though I was not the one trying to fix it. </p>
            <p class="p">I watched my grandpa for another five minutes as he tried to fix the wheel. At this point, I had completely lost hope and I was trying to convince my grandpa to give up as well. He stopped for a second and I thought that he had finally given up. Instead, he took out a lighter and completely burned the string off. He turned to me and said, “You don't fail, until you give up” and resumed the walk home.</p>
            <p class="p">One of my most important memories of my grandfather is fairly recent. During the summer before 7th grade, my parents enrolled me in a summer camp teaching Chinese Americans the Chinese culture and traditional things that we should know. This was a two week summer camp in China where we had to live at a hotel, travel to famous places, and have an authentic Chinese experience. The hotel where we lived was clean but the food that they served there was far from appetizing. During the first few days, a person got food poisoning and had to stay in his hotel room for the rest of the camp. There were no hospitals around and the only medicine that kids had was what their parents had packed them. Because of this, I did not eat the food. Instead, I went to a convenience store across the street and bought a week’s supply of instant ramen, candy, water, and other food items. My grandpa knew that I liked meat and he also knew that I hated not eating meat for long periods so he went on a tiring journey to bring me some meat and sausages. He flew from his home to the city where the hotel I lived in was. Because the hotel was located on the outskirts of the city, he had to walk for hours in the hot sun just to bring me some meat. When he got there, I was touched by his actions and was very grateful for the food that he had brought. He was over 70 and yet he still put me before his own well being and was willing to walk many miles just to make sure I was happy. </p>
            <p class="p">My grandfather has played a major role in my life. He taught me to put people I care about in front of myself. He taught me to never give up no matter how hard things get. Most of all, he taught me kindness. He showed me that it doesn’t matter how people treat me, it only matters how I treat other people. I learned that no matter how mean a person treats me, I will always face him with kindness. </p>

            <p class="center">Recovering Jerk</p>
            <p class="p">When I was in elementary school, I had a very unhealthy lifestyle. I had just moved to a new city and I was a stranger to everything. Soon I dug myself into a hole that I could not get out of. </p>
            <p class="p">After third grade, my parents decided it would be best to leave our apartment and find a house to live in. However, due to the housing prices in our city, they could only consider the houses in different cities, which meant that I would have to move schools. I was enrolled in a school where I had a cool principal, many friends, and exceptionally good grades. To keep all that I had, I hoped that my parents would not be able to find a suitable home and that we could stay in our current one. Despite all my hopes and wishes, my parents eventually found a home and we started to move. </p>
            <p class="p">When my parents bought the house, they figured that it needed some remodeling like changing windows, floors, and paint. This led to me having to endure a two-hour drive every morning to get to school. At school, I was lonely and had no one to talk to. Mainly because I refused to acknowledge the fact that I had moved. I wanted to go back to my old school. My attitude prevented me from seeking out new friends and caused my grades to drop dramatically. I thought that my situation could not get any worse, but when I made my first friend, things worsened. </p>
            <p class="p">When I had finally come out of denial, I wanted to find a friend who I could trust. As I searched for a friend, a new kid arrived at my school and I soon befriended him. Now that I look back, this may have been the worst decision I ever made.  </p>
            <p class="p">During lunch, I went up to him and introduced myself. We soon got acquainted and quickly became friends. After a few days, we became very good friends and hung out during lunch every day talking and walking around the campus. He was my best friend; he was my only friend. I started to become like him and act like him. He was a terrible person. He disrespected everyone and he never did any work. Everyone knew that he was not a good person, but I did not realize it until he did something horrible.</p>
            <p class="p">One day while I was walking in the field with him, he took a shiny horseshoe magnet out of his pocket. He claimed that his father had a collection of rare items and these particular magnets were worth over three hundred dollars. When I heard this, I believed him and I thought that he was a very cool person and I admired him. A few days later, my English teacher asked us if we had seen a metal horseshoe magnet because hers was missing. When she described it, the description matched exactly to the one that my friend had shown me. At first, I thought that it was just a coincidence but as I thought about it, I knew that he was lying. A few days later, he was suspended for theft and I stopped talking to him. Being friends with him, was a horrible mistake but it left a lasting imprint on me. </p>
            <p class="p">Another major mistake that I had made was fairly recent, during the summer right before sophomore year. Ever since I was in middle school, I have practiced swimming every day with a swim team. Over the summer, however, I made a bad decision that reset all my hard work and the effort I had put in during all the years I had swum. </p>
            <p class="p">During the summer, I got tired of swimming and I wanted to take a small break. Though I have had the thought of taking a break many times, I never acted upon it. However, this time was different. After practice, I proposed the idea to my parents and they agreed. They thought that I should take a small break to recover and get stronger. I was surprised that they agreed and I was happy to take what I thought would be a short one month break. </p>
            <p class="p">For a swimmer, a short break can have a pretty big impact on one's performance but it would be fairly easy to recover from. However, if the break is long, the swimmer will be greatly affected; it will take a very long time to recover and the recovery process will be hard and painful. I knew this when I thought of taking a short break. I thought that I would be able to recover since it was only one month. The break, however, was not only a month long. Towards the end of the break, I was getting ready to start swimming again. I had thought that my parents would know to sign me up for the next month but I was wrong. When the day came to return to swim, my dad informed me that he had forgotten to sign me up so the one month break turned into a two-month break. I knew it was my fault that I did not remind him. He signed me up a week before the end of the month so I got ready to go back to swim. On the first day back, my coach told me that my dad had signed me up too late and so my two-month break turned into a three-month break. </p>
            <p class="p">After the month was over, my dad reassured me that I was signed up for the team so my break had finally ended. However, my break was not considered short anymore. The day I got back into the water, I was much slower than before. On the second day back, my whole body was sore and I could not move anything. This continued for weeks and each day I was in pain and much slower than I was supposed to be. In all, I took a painful, long, and grueling month to recover and gain my original speed. This “Short” break that I took reset all my progress and caused me to have to endure a very painful month. </p>
            <p class="p">Though all my mistakes were terrible and caused me suffering, they all helped me learn and become a better person. All my mistakes helped me grow as a person and built a part of my personality. Though they may have been bad mistakes and caused me or others harm, they helped me learn to never make the same mistake again.</p>

            <p class="center">Dreams and Adults</p>
            <p class="p">Most adults don't usually agree with dreams and aspirations that children have. This is because of the different views that they have on certain topics and also the difference in knowledge of how the world works. Children usually have a lack of knowledge and have unrealistic dreams, while adults have more knowledge and see the world more realistically than children. Though some adults support dreams of children no matter how unrealistic they seem, others may straight up tell the child that a dream is impossible to achieve.</p>
            <p class="p">Since I was little, I have had many different dreams. Some are achievable but some are straight-up unrealistic. Both of my parents have different views on these dreams. My mom is the type of person that will support me no matter what I want to do. My dad, on the other hand, has a more realistic view. Though he tries not to crush my dreams, I think it is obvious that he does not support them either. For example, if I were to tell my parents something unrealistic, like wanting to set foot on the sun, both my parents would have different reactions. My mom would support me and encourage me to complete the task. My dad, however, would just sit on the couch and try not to laugh. Though I appreciate him trying not to crush my dreams, I would rather have him just tell me when something is impossible. </p>
            <p class="p">I think that adults don't necessarily want to crush children’s dreams. Every parent wants his or her child to be happy and they want to choose the best for their children. In my opinion, they don't know how to tell someone that a dream is impossible. The best way to act in this situation would be to not do anything about it. Eventually, children will outgrow their unrealistic dream or they will find out for themselves that it is impossible.</p>
            <p class="p">During this time of my life, I think that kids my age should view adults as people who are there to help them. Most adults want to help children succeed and help them not make bad choices in their lives. During this stage, children are at the edge of a cliff, balancing on the edge of reason and imagination. They may not be able to differentiate between what is real and can be achieved and what is just unrealistic and impossible. They think that adults are there to stop them and they always think that they are right and know everything based on what they learned. This, however, is not true. Adults know more than teenagers based on their experience in life. They all lived through their teenage years and they know what choices are harmful. Adults should be trusted and respected instead of being resented.</p>
            <p class="p">A few years ago, when I was about 13 years old, I thought that I knew everything and my parents knew less than me. I thought that I was right and they were always wrong. I did not listen to them and made horrible decisions in my life that affected the rest of my life. During that time, I always argued with my parents and because they did not speak English as well as me, I thought that I was always right. There was a time when my parents told me that I should keep good study habits and learn how to manage my time better. I didn’t listen to them. I thought that what I have been doing was already enough due to the fact that I had decent grades, but as I entered high school, everything changed. </p>
            <p class="p">There was suddenly a big load of homework every day and I had less and less time to do it. I procrastinated until the last minute and sometimes I didn’t even do the work. When I got home, I would get distracted by YouTube or video games which took up most of my time. When I finally got started on my homework, it was already 11 or 12. My poor time management started to affect me little by little every day. My grades dropped and I had very little sleep. I was a mess.</p>
            <p class="p">Now that I look back, if I had listened to my parents about time management, I would be better off. I would have had better grades and I would not have had to stay up so late. Because of my poor choices a few years ago, I still have to fix my mistakes today. I thought that my parents did not know anything. I did not realize that they had experienced the same things as me. I thought of them as people who did not understand me. I thought that they had never gone through hardship in their lives and that I knew how to manage my own time. Now, I realize that adults have much more knowledge than children and that children should only question when something seems unreasonable.</p>

            <p class="center">Never Give Up</p>
            <p class="p">During my life, I have heard the phrase, “Never give up” many times. This phrase supposedly gives a person the power to persevere and to continue despite the pain. I have attempted many things with this phrase in my mind and have achieved many goals due to the motivation that the people around me give me. </p>
            <p class="p">When I first registered for 8th grade, I was going to have only one Honors class,  math. All my other teachers denied me their initials and told me that I was not good enough to be an Honors student. After a week of asking, I came home defeated, with all of my hope, lost. Then, my parents said to me, “Failure is only failure if you give up and stop trying.” Just like how Randy Pausch, the author of The Last Lecture, said, “The brick walls are not there to keep us out. The brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. Because the brick walls are there to stop the people who don't want it badly enough.” If I gave up, I would be one of the people who did not want “it” badly enough, so I continued. The next day, I returned to school with a new plan and acted upon it right away. I had to prove to the counselors and teachers that I was capable and wanted to take advanced level classes badly enough. In the next few days, I talked to the counselors and the teachers and finally got what I wanted.</p>
            <p class="p">Getting to be an honors student was a big achievement, however, It was not my biggest. My biggest achievement is in swimming. When I started to swim, I started later than anyone else. Most of the people on my swim team started when they were five or six, while I started swimming when I was 11. </p>
            <p class="p">In the beginning, I struggled to swim to the opposite side of the pool. I did not know how to breathe and I had to stop in the middle many times. As I watched my friends swim numerous laps back and forth in the pool, I started to think that I could never be as fast as them. I thought that I had started too late and no matter how hard I worked, I would never be as fast as them. Again, I felt defeated. I wanted to just give up and quit swimming. My friends, however, cheered me on and told me that if I put in the effort, I would be as fast and maybe even faster than them. Despite my lack of confidence in myself and the fact that I was their competitor, my friends still gave me hope and pushed me to work harder. Days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months. Before I knew it, a year had passed. </p>
            <p class="p">Over the past year, I have learned all the different strokes and i have worked on my form. Every day, I would want to give up, but my friends and family kept pushing me and I persevered. I woke up every morning, unable to move. Despite all the pain, I continued to swim. Soon, three years had passed and I was going to try out for high school swim. My form was nearly perfect, I had built up strength throughout the years, and I was decently fast. I had gotten faster than the friends that were there at the beginning cheering me on. </p>
            <p class="p">During the winter break of 9th grade, I was able to participate in the Winter age group. This was one of the biggest swims meets for swim teams and was extremely competitive. All the years since I started swimming had been leading up to this meet. As I stood on the block, I thought of when I had just started swimming. I wanted to stop and give up, but my friends were always there to help me and to give me hope. Had I not listened to their advice and had I given up, I would not have been standing on that block. I wouldn't have been swimming at all. I did not get to where I was in an instant, or by being lazy and just sitting around. I had achieved my goal by putting in the effort and persevering until I got to the finish line. I couldn’t give up on something just because it was difficult or too much work; I had to ignore the pain and keep on moving forward. </p>
            <p class="p">All my life, I have thought of giving up. I thought that everything was too much work or too painful. Even now, I still want to give up on swimming, but my family and friends are always there to remind me that I can't. They were always there to help me and to support me even in my most painful times. I learned that even if things are hard, or seem impossible, I just have to continue and eventually, I will achieve my goal. </p>

            <p class="center">A Half Filled Glass</p>
            <p class="p">Many people say that there is a difference between a pessimist and an optimist. Mainly it is the view of the world and how people do things that are different.</p>
            <p class="p">In the pessimists' eyes, the world is full of danger and people should be careful about everything. They believe everything’s negative and think about the worst that can happen in a situation. The optimist, on the other hand, sees the positive side of things. The only difference between these two types of people is the way that they choose to see things. Both the pessimist and the optimist can see the other side of the situation but they choose not to. The pessimist is always able to see the positive side of things but they choose to focus on the negative side due to their own experiences and their train of thought.</p>
            <p class="p">Through my experiences in life, I don't think I am either. A pessimist is usually associated with negative feelings since he sees all the negative aspects of life. The optimist, however, is associated with the positive aspects of life thus he is expected to be positive and upbeat. I am a mixture of both. The way I think is usually considered pessimistic because, in every situation, the negative side makes the most impact on me. For example, if I were to talk in front of a crowd, the first thing I think of is what happens if I mess up, or whether the audience will like me. The way I act after these thoughts is much different than how a pessimist would act. In my experience, pessimists are usually very negative about things but I act pretty positively. I use the negative side of things to encourage myself to do better. Pessimism becomes the motivation for me to be a better person overall.</p>
            <p class="p">Throughout my life, I have met many pessimists as well as optimists. The most impactful person in my life is my dad. He is the most optimistic person I know. When he is presented with a problem, he always finds the positive side of anything even if it is completely negative. One of my funniest memories is when my dad bought a camera set and it ended up being delivered to the wrong address. Usually, at a time like this, a person would complain about it or go to the house that it was delivered to and ask about the package. My dad, however, just shrugged and said, “Well, that lucky family got a free camera.” and proceeded to buy another set. I was inspired by his selfless act and I wanted to be like him and look at the positive side of things more. He showed me that when I look at the positive side, I will have more hope and I will be happier than if I were to look at the negative side of things.</p>
            <p class="p">The most pessimistic person I know has to be my mom. She finds the bad side of anything and everything. Every day, she tells me what I have achieved and all that I could have achieved. She reminds me how I am so much worse than everyone else and that everyone is doing something that I am not doing. Though I know that she cares about me, she always tells me the most negative things in life. She has taught me how to see the world realistically and has  also shown me that rewards come from hard work. </p>
            <p class="p">In my opinion, a person needs both pessimism and optimism. A pessimistic view of the world and an optimistic way of life can make life much more interesting. I think that pessimists are too afraid to do anything because everything that they see is negative, while the optimist has too much hope and does not think too realistically. If everyone was like my dad with the camera, most of the world would be too selfless and ignorant about the problems in life. If everyone was pessimistic, however, the world would be dull and depressing. I think that a person needs a good balance of both negative and positive to maintain a healthy mental state and to have a good way of life. </p>

        <div class="essay">
            <p class="center">The Faucet</p>
            <p class="p">Life is constantly throwing out challenges like a faucet that I can’t turn off. Problems, challenges, and frustrations just keep pouring out, slowly filling my mind until it overflows and becomes uncontrollable. This faucet turned on when I was born and won’t shut off until I die. Between these two points, I have tried to prevent the contents from spilling out and overwhelming me. Slowly, as the container fills, it becomes harder and harder to control and prevent the contents from spilling out.</p>
            <p class="p">In the beginning, many people think that the contents of their buckets are easily controlled and they don't do anything about it. Others try to block the faucet out of fear and prevent the problems from reaching them in the first place. Soon, either because of negligence or fear, problems overwhelm people.</p>
            <p class="p">Throughout my life, I have tried many tactics to try to control the bucket. When I have tried to block out the problems, they have built up over time. As they built up, the chance of my solving them grew slimmer and slimmer. Soon, they burst out and flooded me with negligence from the past. Another tactic I tried was to run away and avoid everything. However, my problems soon caught up to me and once again, they drowned me.</p>
            <p class="p">As my attempts to control my life failed, stress started to take a toll on me. My grades dropped and everything started to fall apart. Insecure thoughts started to fill my head and I became submerged in darkness. I started to think about how others thought of me and whatever my friends even cared about me. I began to lose hope in ever being able to take control and climb out of the pit that I had trapped myself in. I began to feel like I was in a box and like the walls were slowly closing in.</p>
            <p class="p">When hope is lost, the happiness of life begins to fade. Soon I was asking myself,” what am I worth? Does it even matter if I am gone?” Waking up to a new day became joyless. In my eyes, there was nothing but pain and suffering to look forward to every day. I started to stop caring about what I did which caused the problems to increase, eventually stranding me in the middle of an ocean of problems waiting to be solved and fixed. I was hopeless.</p>
            <p class="p">I realized that the approach that I was taking was wrong. I was trying to ignore my problems and move on in life without dealing with them. This is what caused the problems to build up until they became unbearable. If I were to solve the problems as they came in, I would be able to regain control and conquer my problems.</p>
            <p class="p">Through my past experience, I have learned a very important lesson. I learned that running away from my problems will never help me. It will only postpone my pain and increase it. If I face problems head-on, however, I can drain the problems out of the bucket even as they flow in. Life is not about how to prevent problems from taking place, life it is how people deal with problems. Life throws problems at everyone, but it is up to the individual to figure out what to do with them. </p>
